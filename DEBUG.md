# Debug List & Future Improvements

## High Priority
1. **AI Analysis with CSS Fixes**
   - Issue: Re-running analysis shows original issues instead of analyzing with CSS fixes applied
   - Status: Needs Fix
   - Notes: Need to modify AI analysis to consider current state with CSS fixes

2. **Preview Refresh Behavior**
   - Issue: Site reloading frequency makes manual assessment difficult
   - Current State: Improved with manual refresh button
   - TODO: Further optimize refresh triggers

## Performance Issues
1. **AI Recommendations Generation**
   - Issue: Slow to generate recommendations
   - Current Workaround: Reduced token count and simplified prompt
   - TODO: Consider caching strategies or progressive loading

2. **CSS Generation Speed**
   - Issue: Taking longer than desired to generate CSS fixes
   - Current State: Working but slow
   - TODO: Optimize OpenAI API calls, consider caching common fixes

## UI/UX Improvements
1. **Analysis Progress Feedback**
   - Issue: Need clearer indication of analysis stages
   - Current State: Basic loading states implemented
   - TODO: Add progress indicators for each stage

## Future Enhancements
1. **Local Testing Implementation**
   - Status: To Be Implemented
   - Description: Simplify local testing of CSS changes
   - Priority: Medium

## Notes for Developers
- The AI analysis and CSS generation are functional but need optimization
- Manual refresh button added as temporary solution for preview updates
- Consider implementing a caching layer for repeated analyses
